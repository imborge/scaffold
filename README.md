# scaffolding

A CRUD scaffolding library intended to be used with [Luminus](https://luminusweb.com/).

## Rationale

Writing the same CRUD-code again and again is a waste of time.

## TODO

- [ ] Generate migrations to create table(s)
- [ ] Generate CRUD queries
- [ ] Generate CRUD request handlers
- [ ] Generate re-frame events and subscriptions
